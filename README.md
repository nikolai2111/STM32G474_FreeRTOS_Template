## 2. Description
This is a C template for the STM32G474 and the use of FreeRTOS. It also includes some basic wrappers to use FreeRTOS with C++.

I like the STM32G474 because of its versatility and its hardware integrated into the MCU. FreeRTOS is also a very versatile kernel that I also like for its simplicity. So I combined the two in one template. This way I don't have to copy and paste the project or files.

I had a little help from another embedded developer with a problem about using the two malloc functions, one from newlib and one from FreeRTOS. I asked him if it was ok if I put the code on Git, so no worries.
